# pygame Demo

This is a simple pygame demonstration.

Use the arrow keys to move the green ship around. Get points for hitting the blue targets. Targets are worth more the closer they are to the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Lose points for letting a target hit the right edge. Get points when missiles hit the left edge.

You die if you hit the red missiles. Press `r` to restart or `q` to quit.
